    <p class="description">
        I’m not going to kid you, this makes a very rich, moist chocolate cake recipe. 
        So if you are a faint of heart chocolate cake person, this is not the cake for you.
        Based on the Old Fashioned Hershey’s recipe, I sort of went a bit heavy-handed with some changes testing cake after cake until I got it just the way I wanted it, but the end result was oh so worth it. 
        The crumbs left on the plate gave that away.

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ul class="steps">
        <label for="step-1">Preparation</label>
        <li>
            Preheat the oven to 350º F. Prepare two 9-inch cake pans by spraying with baking spray or buttering and lightly flouring.
        </li>
        <label for="step-2">Whisk dry ingredients</label>
        <li>
            Add flour, sugar, cocoa, baking powder, baking soda, salt and espresso powder to a large bowl or the bowl of a stand mixer. 
            Whisk through to combine or, using your paddle attachment, stir through flour mixture until combined well.
        </li>
        <label for="step-3">Mix in wet ingredients</label>
        <li>
            Add milk, vegetable oil, eggs, and vanilla to flour mixture and mix together on medium speed until well combined. 
            Reduce speed and carefully add boiling water to the cake batter until well combined.
        </li>
        <label for="step-4">Bake</label>
        <li>
            Distribute cake batter evenly between the two prepared cake pans. 
            Bake for 30-35 minutes, until a toothpick or cake tester inserted in the center of the chocolate cake comes out clean.
        </li>
        <label for="step-5">Frost</label>
        <li>
            Ease one pie crust into a 9-inch pie plate. 
            Fill with meat mixture, then top with the remaining pie crust. 
            Trim any excess dough, then crimp the edges with the tines of a fork to seal. 
            Prick top crust a few times with a knife to vent steam. 
            Cover the edges of the crust with aluminum foil.
        </li>
        <h4>ESPRESSO POWDER</h4>
        <p>One of the ingredients that really made this cake recipe come to life, in my opinion, was the addition of espresso powder in both the chocolate cake and in the chocolate frosting.</p>
