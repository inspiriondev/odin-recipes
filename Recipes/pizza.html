    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ul class="steps">
        <label for="step-1">STEP 1</label>
        <li>
            Make the base: Put the flour into a large bowl, then stir in the yeast and salt. 
            Make a well, pour in 200ml warm water and the olive oil and bring together with a wooden spoon until you have a soft, fairly wet dough. Turn onto a lightly floured surface and knead for 5 mins until smooth. 
            Cover with a tea towel and set aside. 
            You can leave the dough to rise if you like, but it’s not essential for a thin crust.
        </li>
        <label for="step-2">STEP 2</label>
        <li>
            Make the sauce: Mix the passata, basil and crushed garlic together, then season to taste. 
            Leave to stand at room temperature while you get on with shaping the base.
        </li>
        <label for="step-3">STEP 3</label>
        <li>
            <a href="https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/review/test-best-rolling-pins" target="_blank">Roll out</a> the dough if you’ve let the dough rise, give it a quick knead, then split into two balls. 
            On a floured surface, roll out the dough into large rounds, about 25cm across, using a rolling pin. 
            The dough needs to be very thin as it will rise in the oven. 
            Lift the rounds onto two floured baking sheets.
        </li>
        <label for="step-4">STEP 4</label>
        <li>
            Top and bake: heat the oven to 240C/220C fan/gas 8. Put another baking sheet or an upturned baking tray in the oven on the top shelf. 
            Smooth sauce over bases with the back of a spoon. 
            Scatter with cheese and tomatoes, drizzle with olive oil and season. 
            Put one pizza, still on its baking sheet, on top of the preheated sheet or tray. 
            Bake for 8-10 mins until crisp. 
            Serve with a little more olive oil, and basil leaves if using. 
            Repeat step for remaining pizza.
        </li>
        <li>
            Ease one pie crust into a 9-inch pie plate. 
            Fill with meat mixture, then top with the remaining pie crust. 
            Trim any excess dough, then crimp the edges with the tines of a fork to seal. 
            Prick top crust a few times with a knife to vent steam. 
            Cover the edges of the crust with aluminum foil.
