    <p class="description">This meat pie recipe is delicious! I got it from my husband's mother. 
        She is French so I believe this is a French meat pie. Beef, pork, and potato are all nicely spiced and baked together. 
        It's yummy and pretty easy to make too! 
        It's best served fresh, but you can also make it ahead and freeze or refrigerate it.
        Serve the pie by itself or with a beef gravy.

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ul class="steps">
            <label for="step-">STEP 1</label>
                <li>
                    Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
                </li>
            <label for="step-">STEP 2</label>
                <li>
                    Place potato in a saucepan with enough water to cover. 
                    Bring to a boil, and cook until tender, about 5 minutes. 
                    Drain, mash, and set aside.
                </li>
            <label for="step-">STEP 3</label>
                <li>
                    Meanwhile, crumble ground beef and pork into a large saucepan. 
                    Add onion, garlic, mustard powder, thyme, sage, cloves, salt, and black pepper. 
                    Stir in water. 
                    Cook over medium heat, stirring, until meat is evenly browned.
                </li>
            <label for="step-">STEP 4</label>
                <li>
                    Remove from the heat and mix in mashed potato.
                </li>
            <label for="step-">STEP 5</label>
                <li>
                    Ease one pie crust into a 9-inch pie plate. 
                    Fill with meat mixture, then top with the remaining pie crust. 
                    Trim any excess dough, then crimp the edges with the tines of a fork to seal. 
                    Prick top crust a few times with a knife to vent steam. 
                        Cover the edges of the crust with aluminum foil.
                </li>
            <label for="step-">STEP 6</label>
                <li>
                    Bake in the preheated oven until crust is browned, about 25 minutes.
                </li>
    </ul>
